# Anilist Recommender

Anilist Recommender is simple console application that generates manga and anime recommendations based on user list, series status, rating and other users recommendations.


### Setup:
To start using Anilist Recommender, you have to have Python and pip installed and added to your PATH variable.

If you have them installed, you can clone repo, go to source code directory, and install all required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After this, you can start app with command `python main.py`

### Usage:
App is stupidly simple to use. You just have to type Anilist username when prompted, wait a little and you'll have your recommendations.

#### Disclaimer
This project is still in very early version, so don't use it in anything serious.
